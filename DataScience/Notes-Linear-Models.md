# Linear Models
>basically draw line to seperate featueres 


Decision boundry: line to seperate 2 or more features
> make this line by minimizing the error (so basically make sure that there is the least amount of false positves/negatives)


Weights/Coefficients: the values in the formula of your line that are constant (they decide the direction/height and stuff basically where your line is at)

Distance from the decision boundry can show how wrong the prediction is

> so you can calculate the error with this i think
